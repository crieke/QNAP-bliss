# QNAP-bliss
QNAP  NAS Installer for Bliss album art  manager.
This package will automatically download the latest Bliss package and install it on a QNAP NAS.
Only tested for x86 QNAP NAS.

Known Issues - Audio Fingerprinting does not work yet as it requires additional libraries to be compiled.
             - Update from the Bliss UI does not work yet.  
               If you want to update to the latest version, just reinstall the QPKG as this automatically fetches the latest Bliss build.

This needs the QNAP QDK to  build the QPKG - see the QNAP Forum for details in installing the QDK and building a QPKG
